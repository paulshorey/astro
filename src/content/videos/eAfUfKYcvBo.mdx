Stop being frustrated with your code and take just a few minutes to learn an iterative workflow. Your code will always be working. Your stress level will be low. You'll be able to go for a lunch or a run and not worry about how to fix your broken code. And you'll be able to locate bugs down to just a few lines without doing extensive debugging.
