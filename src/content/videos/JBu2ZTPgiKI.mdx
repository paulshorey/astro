I'm going to "do it live!" as I bring you five essential Design Patterns, from the GoF book, in Typescript, live, as you get to ask questions along the way! Super exciting, I can't wait to see how it turns out!

One thing I can guarantee is that you will come away from this with a decent idea of what these patterns are and code that you can reuse in your applications.
